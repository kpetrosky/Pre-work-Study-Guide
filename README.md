## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
-I need a skill so that I am able to get a different job outside education. My work history and education is only in education and I need to do something else for my mental and physical health.  
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
This project helped give me basics as to what we will be learning in the coming months.
- What problem does it solve?
I was able to create a study guide to access during the pre-work and actually bootcamp.
- What did you learn?
Everything that we did was new to me, so I learned a lot. I learned how to use basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
